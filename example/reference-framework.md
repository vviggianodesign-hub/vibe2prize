# Enhanced Vibe-to-Enterprise Framework
## A Comprehensive Template for Delivery Discussion

Based on the team's insights and industry best practices, here's an expanded framework that addresses gaps and adds critical considerations for enterprise delivery.

---

## Executive Summary

The vibe coding approach fundamentally changes the traditional delivery model by **inverting the requirements process**. Instead of: Requirements → Design → Build → Validate, we now have: Prototype → Validate → Extract Requirements → Harden → Deliver.

This requires new processes, estimation models, and quality gates that don't currently exist in traditional delivery frameworks.

---

## Enhanced Process Model

### Phase 0: Pre-Engagement Qualification (NEW)

**Before vibe coding begins, establish:**

| Criteria | Questions to Answer | Why It Matters |
|----------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Problem Fit** | Is this problem suitable for rapid prototyping? | Not all problems benefit from vibe coding |
| **Client Readiness** | Can the client engage in rapid iteration? | Requires available stakeholders |
| **Complexity Assessment** | Is this UI-heavy or logic-heavy? | Vibe coding excels at UI, struggles with complex business logic |
| **Integration Landscape** | How many systems must this connect to? | Integration complexity is often underestimated |
| **Regulatory Environment** | What compliance requirements exist? | GxP, HIPAA, SOX may require specific processes |

**Suitability Matrix:**

| | Low Integration Complexity | High Integration Complexity |
|---|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **High UI Focus** | ✅ Ideal for vibe coding<br>Ship full clickable experience and capture decisions early. | ⚠️ Prototype UI only<br>Plan integration separately so downstream systems aren’t underestimated. |
| **High Logic Focus** | ⚠️ Careful scoping<br>Validate complex logic early and keep prototype shallow. | ❌ Traditional approach recommended<br>Use classic discovery + design to cover risk surface. |

---

### Phase 1: Rapid Prototyping (Enhanced)

**What the team identified:**
- BA works with client
- 6 hours to working prototype
- Iterate on front-end

**What to add:**

#### 1.1 Prototype Boundaries Document
Before starting, document explicitly:

```markdown
## Prototype Scope Agreement

### In Scope for Prototype:
- [ ] User interface and flow
- [ ] Basic validation logic
- [ ] Sample data handling

### Explicitly Out of Scope:
- [ ] Security implementation
- [ ] Error handling edge cases
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Integration with production systems
- [ ] Data persistence
- [ ] Audit logging

### Prototype Lifespan:
- Created: [Date]
- Valid for client demonstration until: [Date + 2 weeks]
- Code disposal/archive date: [Date + 30 days]

### Client Communication:
Client understands this is:
- [ ] A functional wireframe, not production code
- [ ] For validation purposes only
- [ ] Subject to complete rewrite for production
```

#### 1.2 Prompt Engineering Documentation (NEW)
**Critical for reproducibility and handoff:**

```markdown
## Vibe Coding Session Log

### Session Metadata:
- Tool Used: [Claude/ChatGPT/Cursor/etc.]
- Model Version: [e.g., Claude 3.5 Sonnet]
- Date: [Date]
- BA/Developer: [Name]

### Initial Prompt:
[Exact prompt used to generate initial code]

### Iteration History:
1. [Prompt refinement 1] → [Outcome]
2. [Prompt refinement 2] → [Outcome]
...

### Final Working Prompt Set:
[The prompts that produced the accepted prototype]

### Known Limitations Identified During Session:
- [Limitation 1]
- [Limitation 2]
```

**Why this matters:** When engineers need to understand intent or regenerate components, this documentation is invaluable.

#### 1.3 Client Feedback Capture Template

```markdown
## Client Validation Session - [Date]

### Attendees:
- Client: [Names, Roles]
- Accenture: [Names, Roles]

### Demonstrated Flows:
1. [Flow name] - [Accepted/Rejected/Modified]
2. [Flow name] - [Accepted/Rejected/Modified]

### Verbatim Client Feedback:
> "[Exact quote from client about what they liked]"
> "[Exact quote about what needs to change]"

### Agreed Changes:
| Change | Priority | Client Stakeholder |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| [Change 1] | Must Have | [Name] |
| [Change 2] | Nice to Have | [Name] |

### Open Questions:
- [Question requiring follow-up]

### Sign-off:
Client confirms this prototype represents desired direction: [ ] Yes [ ] Conditional [ ] No
```

---

### Phase 3: Requirements Derivation (Enhanced)

**What the team identified:**
- Front-end behavior = requirements
- Need non-functional requirements
- Need client-specific standards

**What to add:**

#### 3.1 Reverse Engineering Requirements Document

```markdown
## Derived Requirements Specification

### 1. Functional Requirements (Extracted from Prototype)

#### 1.1 User Flows
| Flow ID | Flow Name | Steps | Derived From |
|---------|-----------|-------|--------------|
| FL-001 | File Upload | 1. User drags file... | Prototype screen 1 |

#### 1.2 Business Rules
| Rule ID | Rule Description | Current Implementation | Configurable? |
|---------|------------------|----------------------|---------------|
| BR-001 | File must contain columns X, Y, Z | Hardcoded in validator.js:45 | No → Must fix |

#### 1.3 Validation Rules
| Validation | Trigger | Error Message | Client Confirmed |
|------------|---------|---------------|------------------|
| File size < 10MB | On upload | "File too large" | Yes - meeting 5/1 |

### 2. Non-Functional Requirements (Derived + Assumed)

#### 2.1 Performance
| Metric | Requirement | Basis |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Concurrent Users | 10-20 | "20-50 uses per day" = ~5 concurrent |
| Response Time | < 3 seconds | Industry standard |
| File Processing | < 30 seconds for 10MB | Assumed acceptable |

#### 2.2 Availability
| Metric | Requirement | Basis |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Uptime | 99.5% | Non-critical internal tool |
| Maintenance Window | Weekends OK | Business hours only usage |

#### 2.3 Security
| Requirement | Source |
|-------------|--------|
| SSO Integration | Client requirement |
| Audit logging of uploads | Regulatory assumption |
| Data encryption at rest | Best practice |

### 3. Requirements Gaps (Need Client Input)
- [ ] Data retention policy: How long to keep uploaded files?
- [ ] User roles: Is everyone equal or are there admins?
- [ ] Notification preferences: Email vs. in-app?
```

#### 3.2 Assumptions Log (NEW - Critical)

```markdown
## Assumptions Register

| ID | Assumption | Risk if Wrong | Validation Method | Status |
|----|------------|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| A-001 | Users have modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) | UI may break on IE | Confirm with client | Pending |
| A-002 | Files are always CSV format | Parser will fail | In prototype validation | Confirmed |
| A-003 | Maximum 100 users total | Architecture may not scale | Ask client | Pending |
| A-004 | No offline capability needed | Feature gap | Ask client | Pending |
```

---

### Phase 4: Architecture & Design (NEW PHASE)

**This phase was missing from the team discussion but is critical.**

#### 4.1 Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

```markdown
## ADR-001: Application Hosting Model

### Status: Proposed

### Context:
The vibe-coded prototype runs on a local Flask development server. 
We need to decide on production hosting.

### Options Considered:
1. **Containerized (Docker + Kubernetes)**
   - Pros: Scalable, portable, client may have existing K8s
   - Cons: Complexity for simple app

2. **Serverless (AWS Lambda + API Gateway)**
   - Pros: Cost-effective for low volume, no server management
   - Cons: Cold start latency, 15-min execution limit

3. **PaaS (Heroku, Azure App Service)**
   - Pros: Simple deployment, managed infrastructure
   - Cons: Less control, potential cost at scale

### Decision:
[To be determined with client input]

### Consequences:
[What changes as a result of this decision]
```

#### 4.2 Component Mapping

| Prototype Component | Production Component |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Flask dev server | Gunicorn + Nginx / Cloud Run |
| Local file storage | S3 / Azure Blob / GCS |
| Hardcoded config | Environment variables / Secrets Manager |
| In-memory session | Redis / Database sessions |
| Console logging | CloudWatch / Application Insights |
| No authentication | SSO integration (SAML/OIDC) |
| Sync processing | Queue-based async (for large files) |

#### 4.3 Integration Requirements (NEW)

```markdown
## Integration Specification

### Inbound Integrations:
| System | Integration Type | Data Flow | Authentication |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|----------------|
| Corporate SSO | SAML 2.0 | User identity | Certificate-based |

### Outbound Integrations:
| System | Integration Type | Data Flow | Authentication |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|----------------|
| Email System | SMTP / SendGrid | Notifications | API Key |
| [Future] Data Lake | REST API | Validated files | OAuth2 |

### Integration Risks:
- [ ] SSO provider documentation available?
- [ ] Test environment access for integrations?
- [ ] Rate limits on external services?
```

**What the team identified:**
- Need estimation process
- Need pricing model

**What to add:**

#### 6.1 Effort Estimation Model

**Baseline Formula:**
```
Total Effort = Base Development + (Technical Debt Remediation × Complexity Factor) 
               + Testing + Documentation + Deployment Setup + Buffer
```

**Estimation Template:**

| Activity | Optimistic | Likely | Pessimistic | Expected (PERT) |
|----------|------------|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Technical Debt Remediation** |
| Security fixes | 4h | 8h | 16h | 9h |
| Error handling | 2h | 4h | 8h | 4.3h |
| Configuration externalization | 2h | 4h | 6h | 4h |
| Logging implementation | 2h | 4h | 8h | 4.3h |
| **New Development** |
| SSO Integration | 8h | 16h | 32h | 17.3h |
| Production deployment config | 4h | 8h | 16h | 9h |
| **Testing** |
| Unit tests | 8h | 16h | 24h | 16h |
| Integration tests | 4h | 8h | 16h | 9h |
| Security testing | 4h | 8h | 12h | 8h |
| **Documentation** |
| Technical documentation | 4h | 8h | 12h | 8h |
| User documentation | 2h | 4h | 8h | 4.3h |
| **Deployment & DevOps** |
| CI/CD pipeline | 4h | 8h | 16h | 9h |
| Environment setup | 4h | 8h | 12h | 8h |
| **Buffer (20%)** | | | | ~22h |
| **TOTAL** | | | | **~132h** |

*PERT Expected = (Optimistic + 4×Likely + Pessimistic) / 6*

#### 6.2 Pricing Considerations (NEW)

```markdown
## Pricing Model Options

### Option A: Fixed Price
- Based on estimated hours + margin
- Risk: Accenture absorbs overruns
- Appropriate when: Requirements are clear (prototype validated)

### Option B: Time & Materials with Cap
- Hourly billing up to maximum
- Risk: Shared between parties
- Appropriate when: Some unknowns remain

### Option C: Phased Fixed Price
- Phase 1: Hardening (fixed)
- Phase 2: Enhancements (T&M)
- Risk: Balanced
- Appropriate when: Client wants budget certainty but scope may evolve

### Vibe Code Pricing Adjustment
Traditional new development: X hours
From validated prototype: X × 0.4-0.6 (40-60% of traditional)

**Justification:**
- Requirements already validated (saves 15-20%)
- Working code exists as reference (saves 10-15%)
- Client expectations aligned (saves 5-10% in iterations)
```

#### 6.3 Statement of Work Template Elements (NEW)

## Recommended Discussion Points with Delivery Leadership

1. **Process Ownership:** Who owns this process? Is it delivery methodology, solutions, or a new AI-enablement team?

2. **Tool Standardization:** Should we standardize which AI tools are approved for vibe coding to ensure consistency and compliance?

3. **Training Requirements:** What training do BAs need to do effective vibe coding? What training do engineers need for assessment?

4. **Pricing Model Approval:** Does finance need to approve a new pricing model for vibe-coded-to-production work?

5. **Quality Gate Authority:** Who has authority to approve each gate? Especially for Life Sciences/regulated work.

6. **Liability Considerations:** What are the contractual implications of delivering code that originated from AI tools?

7. **Intellectual Property:** Who owns the prompts? The prototype? Need legal guidance.

8. **Resource Model:** Does this change how we staff projects? (More senior, shorter duration?)
